# Validate existing plugins

## Overview

This command guides you through validating plugins for proper structure, manifest correctness, naming conventions, and documentation completeness. CRITICAL: You MUST use the plugin-development-gtd skill for this task.

## Context

User will provide plugin directory or plugin name to validate and validation scope (structure only, full validation, or specific aspects). The command automatically checks against gtd-cc architectural patterns and conventions.

## Process

Load plugin-development-gtd skill first. Interactively guide the user through this skill and validate-existing-plugins workflow step by step, collecting inputs and executing each step with confirmation.
